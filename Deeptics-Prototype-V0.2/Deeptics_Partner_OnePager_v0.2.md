# Deeptics — Partner Preview (Proto Assets v0.2)

**Why Deeptics**  
Enterprises need **verifiable robotics simulation** that moves beyond demos. Deeptics standardizes robots, sensors, and controllers into **deterministic, PoSml-packaged assets**—so results are **reproducible, auditable, and integration-ready**.

## What’s included
- **21 proto assets** across wheeled, legged, humanoid, aerial, and mobile manipulators
- **Default sensor kits** per asset (RGB-D, IMU, LiDAR, FT/Tactile, Stereo)
- **Controller presets** for locomotion, planning, and manipulation
- **PoSml manifests** + signed artifacts for trustable runs

## Integration points
- **SDK/API**: load assets, swap sensors, run planners, collect metrics
- **Determinism**: fixed seeds + noise profiles for fair evaluation
- **Telemetry**: `metrics.json` (task success, stability, latency, energy proxy)
- **Safety**: workspace guards, joint limits, fail-safe halts

## Sample outcomes partners can validate
- Navigation robustness under sensor dropouts (EKF vs. VIO)
- Manipulation success rate across grippers and grasp strategies
- Quadruped stability on mixed terrains with disturbance injections
- Humanoid push-recovery with whole-body controllers

## Early Partner Program (invite-only)
- **Phase 1 (Design)**: choose 3–5 assets and evaluation metrics that matter to your use-case

- **Phase 2 (Execute)**: we run signed PoSml experiments; partners can mirror runs

- **Phase 3 (Review)**: shared dashboards + audit logs; iterate to target KPIs

- **Phase 4 (Deploy)**: packaged SDK scenario for internal CI and regression testing
